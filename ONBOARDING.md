## One Command Setup

Copy this, paste it in your terminal, hit Enter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevinnOneill/Project-Sidecar.git && cd Project-Sidecar/sidecar-app && npm install && npm run dev
```

Install dependencies and start the Vite dev server. The app opens at `http://localhost:5173`.

## What is SideCar?

SideCar modernizes how the Navy distributes Sailors to assignments. Instead of the detailer passing the Sailor on, the Sailor is passed *through* the detailer with full continuity. No more gaps. No more lost context. Every handoff is tracked, every status is visible, and every decision has a data trail.

Right now, SideCar is a **proof of concept** running on synthetic data. No real Sailor records, no real names, no real SSNs — everything is fabricated with realistic structure so we can build and test before connecting to real systems.

**Who uses SideCar:**
- **Detailers** — The assignment officers who manage Sailor portfolios
- **Placement Coordinators** — Cross-portfolio visibility across an entire community
- **Rating Evaluators** — Enterprise-level distribution analysis

## How This Project Works

This project uses a **governed development framework**. In plain English:

1. **Every module has a boundary.** You work on ONE module at a time. If your task is in `src/Workspace/`, you cannot edit `src/index.css` in the same session. Need to touch another module? Open a new session.

2. **An AI assistant helps you code.** When you open this project in your IDE (Cursor, VS Code, or another AI-assisted editor), the assistant automatically loads the project rules. It knows what you're allowed to do and guides you.

3. **Git hooks catch mistakes at commit time.** If you accidentally break a rule — like using a hardcoded color instead of a CSS token — the commit is rejected. The error message tells you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

4. **Experienced reviewers gate your code.** Your code goes to your branch first, then to a review branch, then to production. Nobody's code goes straight to production.

5. **If you break a rule, the system stops you.** This is called a **halt**. A halt is not a punishment — it's a guardrail. Read the message, fix the issue, try again.

## The 7 Rules

These are the constitutional constraints. They're non-negotiable — the git hooks enforce them automatically.

| Rule | What It Means | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **No `fetch()` calls** | All data comes through `SideCarAdapter` in `src/services/SideCarAdapter.ts`. Never call `fetch()` directly. | SideCar must work offline on NMCI machines with no internet. |
| **No hardcoded colors** | Use CSS tokens like `var(--color-gold-primary)`. Never write hex values outside of `:root`. | Keeps the design system consistent. One change updates everything. |
| **No CSS nesting in build output** | Write flat CSS in component files | NMCI Chrome 110+ baseline for build output |
| **One module per session** | Working on `Workspace/`? Don't edit `index.css` in the same session. | Prevents conflicts when multiple developers work simultaneously. |
| **Synthetic data only** | No real names, SSNs, DODIDs, or command identifiers. | Phase 1A has no authorization for real data. Legal requirement. |
| **Light mode only** | White surfaces + brass gold accents. No dark mode. | Covenant design system specification. |
| **Adapter pattern only** | All data goes through `SideCarAdapter` in `src/services/SideCarAdapter.ts`. Never access data arrays directly. | The adapter swaps between synthetic, CSV, and API data seamlessly. |

## What's a Halt?

A halt means the system stopped you because something wasn't right. **This is good.** Here's what to do:

**AI halt** — You tried to edit a file outside your module:
```
HALT: index.css is MOD-CSS. You declared MOD-WORK.
Close this session and open a new one for MOD-CSS.
```
**Fix:** Stay in your module, or close and start a new session.

**Git hook halt** — You committed code with a violation:
```
HALT: C-11 violation in Workspace.css:45
No hardcoded hex values outside :root. Use CSS custom properties.
```
**Fix:** Replace the hex value with a CSS token, re-stage, and commit again.

**Format halt** — Your commit message was wrong:
```
HALT: Commit message does not match required format.
Required: [SC-YYYY-MMDD-NNN] MODULE-ID: Brief description
Example:  [SC-2026-0325-001] MOD-DET: Add PRD column
```
**Fix:** Re-commit with the correct format.

## Your First Session

Here's what happens when you open the project in your IDE after onboarding:

### 1. The AI loads governance
The AI reads all project rules automatically and confirms:
```
Loaded: WHITE_PAPER.md, Gemini.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, SECURITY.md,
        UI-UX.md, INTEGRATIONS.md, AUDIT.md, TESTING.md, ONBOARDING.md,
        MODULE-MAP.md. Ready.
```

### 2. The AI scopes your work
Before you write any code, the AI asks:
- **Which module?** (MOD-LAND, MOD-WORK, MOD-MEMBER, MOD-CMD, MOD-ANLYT, MOD-SEARCH, MOD-CSS, MOD-SVC)
- **What is your branch?** (dev-1 or dev-2)
- **What are you working on?** (one sentence)
- **What type of changes?** (Functionality, UI/UX, Bug Fix, or Refactor)
- **List your planned changes** (your "edit contract")

### 3. You code within your boundary
Write your code. The AI assists you. If you try to edit a file outside your module, the AI stops you.

### 4. You commit your work
```
[SC-YYYY-MMDD-NNN] MODULE-ID: Brief description
```
Example: `[SC-2026-0325-001] MOD-DET: Add PRD tier column to dashboard table`

### 5. You close the session
- **Clean break:** Close the IDE. Reopen for a fresh session.
- **Quick pivot:** Type "new session" in the AI chat to switch modules.

## Branch Workflow

Your code reaches production in stages. The project uses a **fixed branch model** — there are exactly four branches, all permanent:

```
dev-1 or dev-2  →  qa-staging  →  main
   (your team)      (Tier 1 QA)    (production)
```

Each dev branch is shared by two developers. You push to your assigned branch (dev-1 or dev-2), open a PR to qa-staging, and Tier 1 merges qa-staging into main. Nobody creates new branches. Nobody's code goes straight to `main`. Ever.

## Onboarding Gates (Formal)

No developer begins production work until these gates are cleared:

### Gate 0: Onboarding Agent
Run the one-command setup above. The script handles hooks, branch, dependencies, and orientation automatically.

### Gate 1: Directive Library Review
Read the directives in this order:
1. `directives/Gemini.md` — Master Session Brief
2. `directives/DEVELOPMENT.md` — Development Standards
3. `directives/SECURITY.md` — Data Boundary Law
4. `directives/UI-UX.md` — Covenant Design System
5. `directives/INTEGRATIONS.md` — Adapter Contracts
6. `directives/AUDIT.md` — Verification Protocol
7. `directives/TESTING.md` — Quality Gate

### Gate 2: Load Confirmation
Confirm understanding of:
- The 5 Covenant principles
- The 14 constitutional constraints
- Module boundaries for your assigned page
- Where data comes from and how to access it
- The 4 QA dimensions and pass threshold

### Gate 3: First Commit Review
Your first commit is reviewed by Tier 1 regardless of QA status. This is a calibration step — not a trust issue.

## The Team — Role Map

| Role | Authority | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Module Agent (developer + AI) | Feature code within assigned module | Active Execution Script required |
| Tier 1 (OSC Oneil) | Directive Library ownership. Sole merge authority. | Full program context |
| Orchestrator (AI session manager) | Session management. Execution Script generation. | No production code authority |
| Verifier (independent AI) | Pass/halt verdict on output. | AUDIT.md only. Zero execution context |
| QA Agent | Quality gate scoring. | TESTING.md thresholds |

---

## Development Environment

### On Your Mac (Current)
- Editor: VS Code, Cursor, or another AI-assisted IDE
- AI: Loads governance automatically at session open
- Runtime: Node.js + npm
- Browser: Chrome (`http://localhost:5173` via `npm run dev`)
- Git: Clone, branch, commit, push
- Data: Synthetic generated by `src/services/SyntheticData.ts`

### On NMCI (Target — SPFx Deployment)
- Application deployed as SPFx web part. Build output targets Chrome 110+.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What To Do Instead |
|---|---|
| Hardcoding a hex color | Use the CSS custom property from `:root` |
| Using `fetch()` to load data | Use `SideCarAdapter.ts` which returns synthetic data |
| Modifying `index.css` while on a component module | Request a separate session for CSS changes |
| Adding real Navy data for "testing" | Use synthetic data patterns from SECURITY.md |
| Using CSS nesting (`& .child`) | Use full selector paths |
| Skipping the QA gate for "small changes" | Run the full cycle. Small changes fail too. |
| Interpreting an ambiguous Execution Script | Halt and request clarification |
| Asking AI to "also fix this other thing" | Log it, finish current scope, open new session |

---

## Where to Find Things

| Need | Location |
|---|---|
| Master governance rules | `directives/Gemini.md` |
| All directives | `directives/` folder |
| Constitutional constraints | `directives/Gemini.md` Section 5 |
| Execution Script template | `directives/Gemini.md` Section 7 |
| Module-to-file mapping | `workflow/MODULE-MAP.md` |
| Past session logs | `sessions/` folder |
| Halt history | `lessons/halts.md` |
| Exemplar outputs | `lessons/exemplars.md` |
| Failure patterns | `lessons/patterns.md` |
